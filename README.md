# Markdown Converter

This is a WIP script that will eventually be able to convert entire .md and .markdown files into valid html. Useful for static sites where you don't have a backend to do it automatically. It should be noted that the code here is in no way ready to use and I still have a fair bit of work before it's usable (seeing as how the majority of the information is hardcoded into the script).
